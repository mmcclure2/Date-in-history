# Date-in-history

Like my other c++ file, I have included the executable file so you should not need a compiler to run this. Just make sure that the two files are in the same folder.

In this file, we start by allowing strings to be able to be defined so that whole words can be stored for later use and to allow users to be able to input a response and so messages are able to be printed out to the user.

After this, the main function is going to be defined. At the start we define a string array that is to hold 7 strings, all of which are the name of the days of the week.

Next, we define all of the integers that we will use. All of the inputs that will be stored will need to be entered in the form of numbers instead of words or strings.

After this, we prompt the user for their first input, which will be a month of their choosing. This input is to be stored in the month integer. Next, the user is prompted to enter a day of the month which will be stored in the day integer. Then finally, the user will need to enter a year, which is stored in the year integer.

Next, is where all of the math will take place. Ultimately all of this leads to the d integer, which will do the heavy lifting to find the day of the week that the user entered date fell on in history.

Finally, the user entered date is printed out for the user to read, then shortly after is followed with the day of the week that it fell on. After this, the program will terminate and you are finished.
